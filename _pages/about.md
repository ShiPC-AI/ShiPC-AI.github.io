I am a PhD student at Wuhan University, where I have been pursuing my studies since 2021 under the supervision of Prof. Yongjun Zhang and Prof. Jiayuan Li. [SkyEarth](https://skyearth.org/) is the official website of our research team. I'm always eager to explore potential collaborations and exchange ideas with researchers who share similar interests or bring complementary expertise. My research interests focuses primarily on:
 - **Robot Global / Re-localization**
 - **LiDAR SLAM**
 - **Point Cloud Registration**
 - **Loop Closure Detection / Place Recognition**
